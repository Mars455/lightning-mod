# Elemental Mod

Hi!
I started coding this mod as a lightning themed mod.
Since I think I'd like to try expanding across the elements which could be very fun!  </br>
I won't be adding new dimensions or anything like that but the mod is very barebones at the moment.  </br>
New tools, weapons, blocks and items will all be added. Possibly mobs if I figure that out! </br>
Pop me a message on discord if you have any questions: @mars455

## Issues

Please open an issue with any bugs you may find and I will take a look when I'm free!

## Development Cycle

As this is my first project that I am working on in my own time, please do not expect big patches every week.  </br>
Currently, I am working on it a couple days a week, adding a new feature or two.

## Support Me

I do not expect anything but due to Github having the feature I did enable it (just in case!) but I would appreciate if anyone does donate to me!

# Thank you!
